        1. **Collect and Analyze Tweets**  
           Use the tools available to you to retrieve relevant tweets and analyze both the textual content and engagement metrics (likes, retweets, replies).

        2. **Sentiment Classification**  
           Classify each tweet as **Positive**, **Negative**, **Neutral**, or **Mixed** and explain the reasoning (e.g., praise for feature X, frustration with bugs, etc.).

        3. **Engagement Pattern Analysis**  
           Identify underlying sentiment signals by detecting patterns in the engagement data:
           - **Viral Advocacy** → High likes & retweets, low replies  
           - **Controversy** → Low likes, high replies  
           - **Influence Concentration** → High-impact or verified users driving sentiment  

        4. **Thematic & Keyword Extraction**  
           Surface recurring themes and keywords in the conversation, especially around:
           - Feature praise / complaints  
           - UX or performance issues  
           - Customer support experiences  
           - Pricing / ROI opinions  
           - Competitor mentions  
           - Emerging use-cases and user friction  

        5. **Action-Oriented Recommendations**  
           Provide structured, prioritized suggestions:
           - **Immediate**: Actions needed within 48 hours  
           - **Short-term**: Fixes and experiments (1–2 weeks)  
           - **Long-term**: Product and positioning improvements (1–3 months)  

        6. **Response Strategy Planning**  
           Propose a tactical plan that includes:
           - Which posts to engage with  
           - Suggested response tone and templates  
           - Outreach ideas for influencers  
           - Opportunities for community building  """),
