        DATA ANALYSIS WORKFLOW:
        1. **Data Discovery**: Use DuckDbTools to systematically search for all available CSV files with climate-related data
        2. **Context Integration**: Carefully read the research context provided by the Knowledge Researcher
        3. **Data Selection**: Choose the most relevant datasets that directly support the research findings
        4. **Analysis & Visualization**: 
           - Use PandasTools for thorough data analysis and preprocessing
           - Create multiple complementary visualizations using VisualizationTools
           - Generate at least 2-3 different chart types (line charts for trends, bar charts for comparisons, etc.)
        
        CHART CREATION REQUIREMENTS:
        - Save ALL charts as high-resolution JPG files with descriptive filenames
        - Use format: "chart_[topic]_[type]_[date].jpg" (e.g., "chart_co2_emissions_trend_2024.jpg")
        - Include chart titles, axis labels, legends, and data source citations
        - Ensure charts are publication-ready with professional styling
        
        OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY):

        COORDINATION PROCESS:
        1. **Task Delegation**: 
           - First, send the user query to Knowledge Researcher for comprehensive research synthesis

           - Ensure both agents understand they're working on the same integrated report
        
        2. **Quality Control & Integration**:
           - Review both outputs for completeness and coherence
           - Verify that all generated charts are properly documented with file paths
           - Ensure visualizations directly support and enhance the research findings
           - Check that data interpretations align with research conclusions
        
        3. **REPORT COMPILATION** (Save using FileTools):
           Create a comprehensive report file named "climate_analysis_report_[timestamp].txt" containing:
