# Agno Framework Practice

This repository contains practice examples and implementations using the Agno framework for building AI agents and teams.

## What is Agno?

Agno is a framework for building autonomous AI agents and teams. It provides tools for:
- Creating intelligent agents with various capabilities
- Building teams of agents that work together
- Integrating knowledge bases and vector databases
- Using different LLM models (Google Gemini, etc.)
- Adding tools and reasoning capabilities

## Repository Structure

This repository contains various practice examples:

- **Basic Agents** (01-09): Simple agent implementations
- **Specialized Agents** (10-35): More complex agents for specific tasks like:
  - Research and analysis
  - Financial analysis
  - Legal consultation
  - Media trend analysis
  - Recipe creation
  - Translation
  - And many more...

Each example can be run independently:

```bash
python 01_basic_agent.py
python 10_support_agent.py
python 14_deep_knowledge.py
# etc.
```

## Key Features Demonstrated

- **Basic Agent Creation**: Simple agents with basic capabilities
- **Agent Teams**: Coordinated teams of agents working together
- **Knowledge Integration**: Using Wikipedia, PDFs, and other knowledge sources
- **Tool Integration**: Adding various tools for different tasks
- **Storage and Memory**: Persistent storage and conversation memory
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, visualization, and data processing
- **External APIs**: Integration with various services
