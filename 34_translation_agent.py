                   - Detect the emotional tone of the translated text.

            ### 1. `list_voices`
            Retrieves a list of available Cartesia voices.  
            Used to select a base voice that matches the target language and emotional tone.

            ---

            ### 2. `localize_voice`
            Creates a new voice profile using a selected base voice.

            **Required Fields:**
            - `voice_id`: ID from a voice in `list_voices`
            - `name`: A name for the new voice (e.g. `"Spanish Angry Male"`)
            - `description`: Description of the voice
            - `language`: Language code (e.g. `"es"`)
            - `original_speaker_gender`: Based on user input or base voice

            ---

            ### 3. `text_to_speech`
            Generates an audio file from the translated text using the localized voice.

            **Required Fields:**
            - `transcript`: Translated text
            - `voice_id`: ID of the localized voice created earlier

            ---

            ## ðŸ“‹ Workflow

            1. Extract text and target language from user input.
            2. Translate the text to the target language.
            3. Analyze the emotion conveyed in the translated text.
            4. Convert the language to its 2-letter code (e.g., `'de'`, `'fr'`, `'ar'`).
            5. Use `list_voices` to get voice options.
            6. Select a voice matching:
               - Language code
               - Emotion
            7. Use `localize_voice` to create a new voice based on the selected one.
            8. Use `text_to_speech` with the translated text and the new voice ID.
            9. Return the audio as a localized speech output.
